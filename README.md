## Description

This project is designed to offer a user a searchable weather dashboard and display a 5 - day forecast. This was a homework assignment for Northwest Coding Bootcamp to demonstrate my knowledge of Server Side APIs. The API used to obtain the weather information is located here: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#5days . This project was formatted using almost entirely bootstrap CSS framework and include jquery and dayjs features as well.
